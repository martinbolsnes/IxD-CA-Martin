# Course Assignment Interaction Design - Website for Donations



## Brief
We are building a web service that reimagines the donation process for the modern world, making it user centric. 

Today we have modernised a lot of services, Vipps for sending money online, Spotify for listening to music online, Amazon for buing products online. But the way donation to charities works has largely been at a standstill. 


What if there was a platform where you could:
- donate to your several of your favourite charities in one place. 
- set the amount as low or as high and as often as you would like. 
- see the total amount donated over the years and total amount saved in taxes. 
- shop for charities as you would on Amazon or Komplett. 


Chose between a target audience between 20 to 40 or 60 years or older 
For this assignment. 

You will be asked to do interviews and usability testing with you target audience so make sure you select a group that you can get in touch with and that also will assist you in doing interviews and usability testing. 


For finding charities that are approved for tax reduction please visit :https://www.skatteetaten.no/person/skatt/hjelp-til-riktig-skatt/gave-og-arv/gave-til-frivillige-organisasjoner/liste/ or you could use API https://noroffcors.herokuapp.com/https://jsonkeeper.com/b/BMBO

Here are some examples from the site:
- DYREVERNALLIANSEN
- REGNSKOGFONDET
- DYSLEKSI NORGE
- MENTAL HELSE
- NORGES JEGER OG FISKEFORBUND
- NORGES HANDIKAPFORBUND





## Level 1 Process
Conduct an interview with a person from the target audience. That way you gain empathy and understanding for how the people we are making this for thinks about donations. 

Make a website with the features allowing the users to do the following:
1. Shop / select charities 
2. Decide the amount and how often donations are made
3. Register an account (form - name, email address and password)
4. Overview of total donations and tax reduction

The register account form should have a validation where you check the email adress for @-sign. 
Password must be 8 characters long and should contain a number. Use error messages.

Do a minimum of one usability test where you invite a person to go through the process of donating. Example a donatian made to three charities for 10.000 nok twice a year, where they split the sum 20%, 30% and 50% between the charities.





## Level 2 Process
Make a feature that calculates what the donation amounts to in tax savings. 
JavaScript image slider + popup modal 




## Submission
